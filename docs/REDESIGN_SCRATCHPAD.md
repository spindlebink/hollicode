# Language redesign scratchpad

Hollicode's experimental right now, so a lot of the decisions that've been made may be altered in later versions. Right now, even things like syntax and bytecode specification are in flux. In this document I'd like to address some possible alterations.

## Bytecode

The current bytecode works really well. I like the design choice of separating syntax from generated bytecode, especially given the in-between status of Hollicode's bytecode instruction set i.e. lower-level than straight-up scripting but much higher than "real" VM instructions.

### Cut off extraneous ops

We may be able to remove `RET` in favor of `JMP` at the end of options. Need more thought put into this--doing so may sacrifice the flexibility of options, since right now they're guaranteed to return to the last `wait` directive, wherever it was, and we'd need to analyze and figure out where the associated `wait` statement would be for a `JMP` at compile time.
